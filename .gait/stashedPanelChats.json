However, there are some differences and use cases for each. Here's a comparison:\n\n### Interface\n- **Extensibility**: Interfaces can be extended using the `extends` keyword.\n- **Declaration Merging**: Multiple declarations of the same interface are merged.\n- **Class Implementation**: Interfaces can be implemented by classes.\n\n### Type\n- **Union Types**: Types can represent union types (e.g., `type A = B | C`).\n- **Intersection Types**: Types can represent intersection types (e.g., `type A = B & C`).\n- **Primitive Types**: Types can alias primitive types (e.g., `type StringAlias = string`).\n\n### Example Comparison\n\n#### Interface\n```typescript\ninterface InlineChatInfo {\n    fileName: string;\n    content: string;\n    lineCount: number;\n    startTimestamp: string;\n    startSelection: vscode.Position;\n    endSelection: vscode.Position;\n    selectionContent: string;\n    selectionSurroundingContent: string;\n    endTimestamp: string;\n    prompt: string;\n    diff: Diff.Change[];\n}\n```\n\n#### Type\n```typescript\ntype InlineChatInfo = {\n    fileName: string;\n    content: string;\n    lineCount: number;\n    startTimestamp: string;\n    startSelection: vscode.Position;\n    endSelection: vscode.Position;\n    selectionContent: string;\n    selectionSurroundingContent: string;\n    endTimestamp: string;\n    prompt: string;\n    diff: Diff.Change[];\n};\n```\n\n### When to Use Which\n- **Use [`interface`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fkylel1%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fgait-copilot%2Fsrc%2Finline.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A37%2C%22character%22%3A7%7D%7D%5D%2C%221bb6016c-ad90-4db5-a3b6-7e94c851d48c%22%5D \"Go to definition\")** when you need to define the shape of an object and expect it to be extended or implemented by classes.\n- **Use `type`** when you need to define union types, intersection types, or alias primitive types.\n\n### Example Usage in Your Code\n\nGiven your code snippet, you can use either [`interface`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fkylel1%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fgait-copilot%2Fsrc%2Finline.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A37%2C%22character%22%3A7%7D%7D%5D%2C%221bb6016c-ad90-4db5-a3b6-7e94c851d48c%22%5D \"Go to definition\") or `type` to define [`InlineChatInfo`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fkylel1%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fgait-copilot%2Fsrc%2Finline.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A37%2C%22character%22%3A17%7D%7D%5D%2C%221bb6016c-ad90-4db5-a3b6-7e94c851d48c%22%5D \"Go to definition\").
